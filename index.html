        <h2><strong>Yours Truly,</strong></h2>
        <p>
My motivation is my weakness when I don’t understand, I simply ask.
When I want to know something new I seek answers, when I need results, I generate a formula to produce the best after effect.
I consider myself a forward thinker, I look to the future when I calculate my present locus.
I strive to leave my mark in the future, so it’s only right I involve myself in the tech world, I recognize that technology is going to be inevitable in our existence, and I plan on coding my say in it.
Starting as a wide-eyed ambitious intern at Microsoft, on the windows device team to being offered a position as a software test engineer on the surface team shortly after thought me interchangeable mannerism that I possess.
I come equipped with a balance of confidence and empathy, a strong community leader I feel should have a high IQ with higher emotional intelligence,
with my balance of both I strive to become a technical program manager in the future, below you will learn why I am a strong qualifier.</p>
